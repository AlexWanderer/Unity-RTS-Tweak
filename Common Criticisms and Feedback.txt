Common Criticisms/Feedback


I played your game couple times
it's very  confusing at first
so the division time is very long
and you cannot do anything while dividing - that's boring
It seemed to me that after division I had two blobs 10 power each
but It would be more logical to have 5/5 each
than the attacking part is confusing
I was not able to tell what is happing
and how the damage is applied to enemy
